# recipe
So this is a recipe program I am making for my self to help keep track of some of my favorites, allowing the addition of exact product ingredients and measurements.
Along with that also keeping track of the nutritional facts of each product allowing you to get an idea of the total nutrition values of your recipes down to the serving
portions as well. I want recipes to also throw warnings for food allergies based on ingredients within products or if they were made in facilities that also process 
products that cause food allergies.

Once the Barcode database part of the program is done this repository will be set to private.

As for my code it will most likely not be done very well I am pretty new to coding python. I started learning python on 9/26/2021 and this is the result of what i have 
learned to the best of my knowledge thus far. I took a class for C# and did nothing with it for a couple years so that is where my ideas for header & commenting come
from but beyond that I don't remember much. Thank you for taking a look.
